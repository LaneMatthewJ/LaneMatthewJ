# Hello There! 

This is my github account.

My name is Matthew Lane. Im a Graduate Research Assistant in the Computational and Predictive Biology Group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory working under Dr. Dan Jacobson.

Currently, my research centers around the application of statistical, graph theoretical, machine and deep learning methods for prediction and analysis of complex biological systems using the leadership class systems Andes, Summit, Perlmutter, and Frontier.

Research undertakings currently include:

- Using Explainable AI to create massive Predictive Expression Networks for use in Multiplex Omics models.
- Employing geometric deep learning for node embedding and link prediction on large and sparse networks.
- Metabolomic profile network creation through peak extraction and statistical processing of LC/GC-MS data.
- Scientific Software engineering for the production of well-tested and documented packages for publication.
- Topological Perturbation of networks for the phenotypic prediction of genetic modulation.

I earned my M.S. in Computer Science under Dr. Sharlee Climer at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, working on network theory techniques for the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid metabolites in patients of Alzheimerâ€™s disease. I then moved on to work as a software engineer at Bayer Crop Science, developing software for the collection, storage, and analysis of crop field data.
